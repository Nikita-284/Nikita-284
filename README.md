# Nikita Gill



Hey there! 👋 I'm Nikita Gill, a data enthusiast on a mission to unlock insights and tell stories through numbers. Currently based in sunny Tampa, Florida 🌴, I spend my days diving into data, crafting Python scripts, and SQL queries that unravel complex puzzles.
With a solid background in SQL, Python, and dashboard building, I've had the pleasure of collaborating with multiple companies to strengthen their data systems and drive informed decisions.

When I'm not crunching numbers, you'll likely find me busting a move on the dance floor 💃, exploring new corners of the world ✈️, or hitting the gym 🏋️‍♂️. I'm passionate about healthy living and love chatting about nutritious eats and maintaining a balanced lifestyle.

Oh, and let's not forget my guilty pleasures – I'm a die-hard Bollywood fan 🎬 and a Netflix series binge-watcher 🍿. Got any recommendations? I'm all ears!

Feel free to reach out for a chat about data, dance, travel, fitness, or the latest binge-worthy TV shows. Let's connect and share some good vibes! ✨
